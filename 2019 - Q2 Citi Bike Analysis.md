2019 - Q2 Citi Bike Analysis

The approach was to take a snapshot of the Citi Bike Data.  The data chosen was April-June 2019.  Spring was chosen in order to find a usable size of data as well as identify any trends at the start of the warmer months.  Two distinct areas stood out as opportunities to explore. 

Customers vs. Subscribers usage and demographic data.  

The program offers two different types of passes.  A one year subscriber and a short term Customer.  The analysis of the data found that these two types of consumers usage of the program was very different.  

The puropse of this analysis was to better equip Citi Bike with information that can be used to market the program to both groups and improve upon the messaging in specific locations to increase usage for both groups.
